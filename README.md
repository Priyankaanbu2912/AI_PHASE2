## Project Overview

This project is designed to explore and predict company registration trends using AI techniques and historical data from the Registrar of Companies (ROC). It provides valuable insights for government agencies, businesses, and researchers to understand and anticipate registration trends. 

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Prophet (for Prophet model), TensorFlow (for Neural Network model)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn statsmodels fbprophet tensorflow

Data
Place your dataset file in the project directory (e.g., company_registrations.csv). Ensure the dataset contains the necessary information, including registration dates and registration counts.

If your dataset requires preprocessing or cleaning, you can customize the data loading and preprocessing steps in the respective Python scripts.

Running the Code
The project includes three different AI models for forecasting: ARIMA, Prophet, and a Neural Network. You can choose which model to use based on your preferences and data characteristics.

ARIMA Model
Open the ARIMA_forecasting.py script.

Modify the file path to your dataset by replacing "company_registrations.csv" with your data file's name.

Run the script using Python:

bash

python ARIMA_forecasting.py
Prophet Model
Open the Prophet_forecasting.py script.

Replace "company_registrations.csv" with your dataset file name.

Run the script using Python:

bash

python Prophet_forecasting.py
Neural Network Model
Open the Neural_network_forecasting.py script.

Update the data file path as needed.

Run the script using Python:

bash

python Neural_network_forecasting.py
Output
Each script will generate forecasts and evaluation metrics. You can expect to see results such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in the console or saved in output files.

Sample Output
Here is an example of what the output might look like:

yaml

ARIMA RMSE: 123.45
Prophet RMSE: 98.76
Neural Network RMSE: 112.34

# AI-Driven Exploration and Prediction of Company Registration Trends with Registrar of Companies (ROC)

## Project Overview

This project is designed to explore and predict company registration trends using AI techniques and historical data from the Registrar of Companies (ROC). It provides valuable insights for government agencies, businesses, and researchers to understand and anticipate registration trends.

**Data Sources**

The primary data source for this project is the Registrar of Companies (ROC), which maintains a comprehensive database of company registrations. The dataset used in this project contains historical registration data, including registration dates and the number of companies registered on each date.

The dataset is assumed to be in a structured format, typically a CSV file, and should include the following columns:

- `registration_date`: The date of company registration.
- `registrations`: The number of companies registered on the given date.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.
